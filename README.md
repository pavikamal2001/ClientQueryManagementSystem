# ClientQueryManagementSystem

The Client Query Management System is a simple online application created with Streamlit, PostgreSQL, and Python to help teams manage customer concerns more effectively.  Clients can quickly submit issues that are safely kept in a database.  The support team can then review these requests, change their status, and close them after they are resolved.  The system employs Pandas to clean and display data, while Streamlit provides a user-friendly and interactive front-end interface.  This project combines Python, SQL databases, and real-time UI features to improve communication, speed up issue resolution, and increase customer satisfaction.  Overall, it offers a professional, well-organized workflow for handling support duties in any business.
